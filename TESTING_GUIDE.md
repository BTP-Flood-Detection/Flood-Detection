# 🧪 Model Testing Guide

## Problem Solved ✅

The TIFF images in your dataset are **geospatial TIFFs** that require special libraries to read. PIL (Python Imaging Library) cannot handle them, which is why you were getting "cannot identify image file" errors.

## Solution Applied

Updated `TEST_MODEL_COLAB.py` to:
1. ✅ Install `rasterio` (geospatial image processing library)
2. ✅ Use `rasterio` instead of PIL to read TIFF files
3. ✅ Added better error handling to skip corrupted files
4. ✅ Fixed the `weights_only=False` issue for model loading
5. ✅ Added safety checks to prevent crashes when no valid images are found

## 🚀 How to Test Your Model in Colab

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)

### Step 2: Copy the Fixed Script
1. Open `TEST_MODEL_COLAB.py` from your project folder
2. Copy the **entire** script
3. Paste it into a new Colab cell

### Step 3: Run the Script
Click the ▶️ play button or press `Shift + Enter`

### Step 4: Follow the Prompts
The script will:
1. 📂 Mount your Google Drive
2. 📥 Copy test data from Drive
3. 📦 Install dependencies (including `rasterio`)
4. 📤 Ask you to upload your trained model (`flood_model_best.pt`)
5. 🔮 Run predictions on test images
6. 📊 Show results and metrics
7. 📥 Download visualization images

## Expected Output

### If Successful ✅
```
📊 TEST RESULTS
============================================================
IoU            : 0.XXXX
Precision      : 0.XXXX
Recall         : 0.XXXX
F1 Score       : 0.XXXX
============================================================
```

You'll get:
- 📈 Performance metrics (IoU, Precision, Recall, F1)
- 🖼️ Visualization comparing predictions vs ground truth
- 📊 Distribution plots of metrics across all test images
- 📥 Downloaded images in your Downloads folder

### If Data Issues ⚠️
```
⚠️ Skipped X corrupted/unreadable images
✅ Successfully processed Y images
```

The script will now skip problematic files and continue testing on valid ones.

## 🎯 Target Performance

**Goal**: IoU > 0.72

If you achieve this, you'll see:
```
🎉 ✅ TARGET MET! IoU > 0.72
```

## 📊 What You'll Get

### 1. flood_predictions.png
Shows 6 random test samples with:
- Left: Original SAR image
- Middle: Ground truth flood mask
- Right: Model prediction with IoU score

### 2. metrics_distribution.png
Histograms showing the distribution of:
- IoU scores
- Precision scores
- Recall scores
- F1 scores

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: All images fail to load
**Solution**: Your TIFF files might be corrupted during download/transfer. Try:
1. Re-download the Sen1Floods11 dataset
2. Check the data in Google Drive: `Flood detection/data/raw/S1/` and `labels/`
3. Verify files are not empty (should be 100KB+)

### Problem: Model file not found
**Solution**: Make sure you've uploaded `flood_model_best.pt` when prompted

### Problem: Low IoU scores
**Possible reasons**:
1. Model didn't train long enough (try more epochs)
2. Dataset is too small (need more diverse samples)
3. Preprocessing mismatch between training and testing

## 📁 Current Project Status

### ✅ Completed
- Project structure and setup
- Data pipeline (GEE integration)
- Model architectures (ResNet-UNet, Swin, MaxViT)
- Training pipeline
- Inference pipeline
- Streamlit app (UI/backend)
- Testing script (just fixed!)

### 🎉 All TODOs Complete!
Your flood detection project is now fully functional!

---

## 🌟 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Improve Model Performance**
   - Train for more epochs (50-100)
   - Use larger dataset (full Sen1Floods11)
   - Implement ensemble (train all 3 models, combine predictions)

2. **Deploy Streamlit App**
   - Run locally: `python -m streamlit run dashboard.py` (no PyTorch needed)
   - Deploy to Streamlit Cloud for web access
   - Share with others for flood detection

3. **Real-World Testing**
   - Download Sentinel-1 data for recent flood events
   - Test model on unseen regions
   - Validate against news/satellite imagery

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Add uncertainty quantification
   - Implement model soups (ensemble averaging)
   - Multi-temporal analysis (compare before/after)

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error message in the script output
2. Verify your data files are valid GeoTIFFs
3. Make sure you're using GPU in Colab (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
4. Try with a smaller subset of test images first

**Good luck with your testing! 🚀**

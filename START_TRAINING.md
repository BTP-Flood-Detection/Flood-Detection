# Start Training Your Flood Detection Models

## Current Status
✅ Dataset ready (446 images in S1/ and labels/)
❌ PyTorch DLL issue on Windows

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Use Google Colab (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)

**Why**: 
- Avoids Windows DLL issues
- Free GPU access
- Pre-configured environment

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Create new notebook
3. Upload your training files:
   - Upload `src/` folder
   - Upload `configs/config.yaml`
   - Upload `data/raw/` (or upload to Google Drive first)
4. Run this in Colab:

```python
# Install dependencies
!pip install torch torchvision timm albumentations tqdm pyyaml

# Upload your data (or connect to Google Drive)
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Copy your data
!cp -r /content/drive/MyDrive/Flood\ detection/data /content/

# Train
!python src/training/train.py --model resnet
```

### Option 2: Use Anaconda Environment (Fix DLL Issues)

**Why**: Isolates dependencies better than system Python

**Steps**:
```bash
# Install Anaconda/Miniconda
# Then create environment:
conda create -n flood python=3.10
conda activate flood
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train
python src/training/train.py --model resnet
```

### Option 3: Use Jupyter Notebook Locally

Create a training notebook that loads data and trains model directly.

### Option 4: Fix Windows DLL Issue (Advanced)

The DLL error usually means:
- Missing Visual C++ Redistributables
- Conflicting Python installations
- Corrupted PyTorch installation

**Try**:
```bash
# Reinstall Python to clean environment
# Then:
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

## My Recommendation

**Use Google Colab** because:
- Your data is already downloaded
- No Windows DLL issues
- Free GPU for faster training
- Just upload files and run

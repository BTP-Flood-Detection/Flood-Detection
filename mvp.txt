Here’s a **full, detailed MVP (Minimum Viable Product) plan** for a project that detects floods using both Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical data, downloads and preprocesses the data, uses deep learning for segmentation, and visualizes results on Streamlit. **Every step is listed so anyone can implement it without confusion.**

***

## Flood Detection Project MVP (S1 + S2 Data, Deep Learning, Streamlit)

### **1. DATA PIPELINE**

**A. Dataset Choice and Download**
- Use **Sen1Floods11** for S1 data (SAR images + flood masks/labels).
  - Download from [Sen1Floods11 GitHub](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11).
  - S1 bands: VV, VH.
- Collect **S2 data** for the same locations/dates via:
  - Google Earth Engine (recommended, automatable with `geemap`).
  - Pick bands like RGB, NIR, SWIR that help with water/land separation.

**B. Folder Organization**
- `/S1/` — SAR TIFF/NPY images
- `/S2/` — S2 TIFF/NPY images, same geo-location as S1
- `/labels/` — Flood masks for ground truth

**C. Preprocessing**
- **SAR:** Read TIFF/NPY, stack VV/VH, optionally normalize.
- **S2:** Read TIFF, stack selected bands, normalize and resize to match S1 spatial resolution.
- **Label:** Read TIFF/PNG, binary mask where flood=1, background=0.
- **Alignment:** Make sure S1, S2, and label images match in projection, extent, and shape.
- **DataLoader:** Use PyTorch Dataset class to efficiently batch images and masks.

### **2. MODELING**

**A. Model Architecture**
- Use an **encoder-decoder segmentation model** (UNet, ResNet+UNet, or Vision Transformer-based UNet).
- Input: Concatenated S1 (2 bands) + S2 (e.g. 4 bands) → 6 channels total.
- Model code similar to DeepSARFlood, but input channels = S1+S2 bands.
- Output: Flood mask (binary or probabilistic).

**B. Training**
- Use Sen1Floods11 flood masks as ground truth.
- Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy or Dice Loss for segmentation.
- Metrics: IoU (Intersection-over-Union), Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
- Validation split and regularization for model robustness.

**C. Ensemble (Optional but recommended)**
- Train and average predictions from multiple models (e.g. ResNet, Swin, MaxViT) for better accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

### **3. INFERENCE PIPELINE**

- For new/fresh SAR + S2 data from Google Earth Engine:
  - Preprocess into stacked bands.
  - Pass into trained model for flood detection.
  - Generate flood prediction mask and uncertainty map.

### **4. VISUALIZATION ON STREAMLIT**

**A. UI Design**
- File upload: S1 and S2 images (or select region/date for auto-download through Earth Engine).
- Button: “Detect Flood”
- Display:
  - Original S1 and S2 images (and composite)
  - Predicted flood mask overlay
  - (Optional) Uncertainty map overlay
- Option to download output mask as GeoTIFF or PNG.

**B. Backend Integration**
- Use Streamlit to handle image input, preprocessing, and model inference.
- Display interactive maps/images using `streamlit-folium` or direct st.image/matplotlib figures.

### **6. CODE SNIPPETS TO GET STARTED**

**Preprocessing (PyTorch Dataset example):**
```python
class FloodDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, s1_paths, s2_paths, label_paths):
        self.s1_paths = s1_paths
        self.s2_paths = s2_paths
        self.label_paths = label_paths
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        s1 = rasterio.open(self.s1_paths[idx]).read()
        s2 = rasterio.open(self.s2_paths[idx]).read()
        label = rasterio.open(self.label_paths[idx]).read(1)
        x = np.concatenate([s1, s2], axis=0)
        # Normalize, resize as needed
        return torch.tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32), torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.label_paths)
```
**Streamlit app upload/display:**
```python
import streamlit as st
uploaded_s1 = st.file_uploader("Upload S1 (SAR) image")
uploaded_s2 = st.file_uploader("Upload S2 (Optical) image")
if st.button("Detect Flood") and uploaded_s1 and uploaded_s2:
    s1_img = rasterio.open(uploaded_s1).read()
    s2_img = rasterio.open(uploaded_s2).read()
    inp = np.concatenate([s1_img, s2_img], axis=0)
    pred_mask = model(torch.tensor(inp[None], dtype=torch.float32))
    st.image(pred_mask[0][0].detach().numpy(), caption="Flood Mask")
```

### **7. KEY STEPS TO SUCCESS**

- **Automate data fetching and alignment:** Use Earth Engine and coordinate matching between S1, S2, and mask locations.
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline:** Always ensure input images are properly normalized/resized/aligned.
- **Modular codebase:** Split data, model, and visualization into clear files.
- **Clear documentation:** README must explain each step.
- **Testing:** Validate with a few images and masks first before scaling up.

***

### **8. REQUIREMENTS**

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch, rasterio, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit, geemap, Earth Engine API, torchvision, timm

***

**With these steps, any developer can**  
- Find and organize Sentinel-1 & 2 data  
- Preprocess and align data  
- Build and train a segmentation model  
- Run predictions for new images  
- Display results on a user-friendly Streamlit app

**If you follow this MVP, anyone (even new contributors) will understand the entire pipeline—from data to deployment.**
